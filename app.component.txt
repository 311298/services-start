section9: services
====================================================================

107.
we can create a service class and implement our methods there.
but calling class manually isn't the correct way.

108.
in constructor of component -> private variable : serviceClassName
in @component -> providers array [serviceClassName]

109. && 110. && 111.
code is written and saved in text file for better understanding.
I have re-created the project again to understand thing clearly rather than copy pasting.
go to ->

112.
for injecting serice inside the service we need to add the meta data to serice class called @Injectible.

113.
we can do the communication between the components and emit events form one component another component without use of output().
define it inside the serivce.
emit the data which we want to receive in another component.
subscribe the event variable inside the component.

14.
for application wide service injection we can use
    @Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
    export class MyService { ... }


end
